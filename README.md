# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.
The app uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file.

## Example Story

As a user I want to be able to take notes and be able to save it so I can check back and also
be able to track my progess on my tasks.
