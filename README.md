# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.
The app uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve user generated note data from a JSON file.

### User Story

AS A small business owner  
I WANT to be able to write and save notes  
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
